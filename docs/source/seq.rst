==================================

This section overview the Y86-64 sequential implementation. We assume that you have learned data path of Y86-64 SEQ in the lecture.
If you wan to review the Y86-64 SEQ data path, you can read the Chapter 4.3 of Bryant book. This section lists important figures for the implementation.
